# react-starter

This is a boilerplate code template for starting a new project
using React.

It's intended to only contain the basic tools needed for a simple project.

## Tools being used:

* [React.JS](https://github.com/reactjs)
* [Redux.JS](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) (to be added)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (ES6 mapper and compiler)
* [Express.JS](http://expressjs.com/) (Node.JS server for serving the pages)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) + [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) (Building tools)

### Building the Project:

in the console run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

npm start executes the Express server, which will run the webpack config.
